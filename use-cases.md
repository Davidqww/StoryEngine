## Stephanie Wright, Mozilla Science Program Lead, Mozilla Foundation

I first stumbled upon StoryEngine at a Mozilla work week. It was at a time where we had had a change in [Science Lab](https://science.mozilla.org/) leadership and were working on strategic planning. We had just started the [Working Open Workshop](https://mozillascience.github.io/WOW-2017/)s and [Open Leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/) mentoring programs and were trying to figure out what to do going forward. I heard there were several stories of people from the Science Lab and took the time to read them. The stories were so powerful — they called out things that I didn't realize were important for our participants. They talked specifically about how our programs helped them, and what they were able to do next. These insights were key to our strategic planning.

I've used the stories since then for a number of different things. For example, when we were working on the Mozilla Network 50 nominations the stories were helpful **to remember who accomplished what**. Then, when I wrote the nomination letters, I pulled specifics from people’s stories.

I also use StoryEngine to **write grant proposals**. It’s a huge corpus of material that I use when I want to talk about our community, our network, and our impact. When I’m trying to find support for one of our programs I go there to see what stories we have. I pull evidence quotes from StoryEngine — examples of how existing funding has impacted people. I can write about how open science is important because it does this and it does that, but others don’t relate to that until I pull in a story that shows why open science is important to a specific person. That's the power of a story. Until I actually give them examples of how open science has impacted people's lives it doesn't matter. That's especially crucial for funders.

The Science Lab is now in the process of finishing up an **impact evaluation**. We brought in outside consultants and are specifically evaluating the Working Open Workshops, the mentorship training, and the [Open Science Fellowships](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships). I was able to take this body of stories and give it to our impact evaluators and say “Hey, look. This is some qualitative feedback regarding these programs that you can use in the evaluation.” They used the StoryEngine stories in conjunction with their own interviews and surveys. It was a body of knowledge that we desperately needed for the evaluation — there are so many gems in there and it kept the evaluators from having to interview everyone all over again — they were able to pull from the stories that were already collected.

I like that everything is there. I can just paw through for what I need. It might be too much for people who are just looking for something short and sweet, like highlights with the ability to click through to more in-depth stories. But I'm a librarian, I'm used to large bodies of information and I’m able to find what I want. And what I need is details — I need all of it so I can use it for all of my different purposes.

It's so perfect for what I need to do. _**We’re building community and that needs stories**_. This is such a valuable resource to me. I love it. I need it. I want more.
