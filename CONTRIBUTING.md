# Contributing to StoryEngine

Welcome! :boom::book: Thanks for your interest in contributing to StoryEngine — we're excited you're here! :book::boom:

StoryEngine is a way to do research and evaluation for anyone who wants to listen to the people that matter most to them. It uses interviews to draft stories that are then edited with each participant. These stories can then be used for marketing, communications, advocacy, and more — while forming a dataset that can be used to surface insights and learning.

The following is a list of guidelines for contributing to the StoryEngine project which is hosted by [LoupDesign](https://github.com/LoupDesign). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [StoryEngine Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LoupDesign/StoryEngine/blob/master/CODE%20OF%20CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to github@loup.design.

## What are issues and pull requests?
**Issues** are essentially ways to report errors or bugs. In the case of StoryEngine, we also use issues to call attention to specific tasks and areas we need help tackling.

When you help us tackle those issues, you will most likely be in the form of a **pull request**. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that we review and pull in your contribution and merge them into our branch. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.

## How can I contribute?

### Tackle an issue / further the project
Help us tackle issues. These [labels](#issue-and-pull-request-labels) will help you find an issue that matches your talents or expertise. Then use a pull request to help resolve the issue.

### File an issue
Notice a problem but don't know how to fix it? File an issue.  Please use these [labels](#issue-and-pull-request-labels) (as applicable) to file an issue

### File a pull request
File a pull request for specific recommendations on how to improve our content or fixes to copy errors. Please use these [labels](#issue-and-pull-request-labels) (as applicable) to file a pull request.

### Suggest an area of enhancement to the project
Don't see yourself on this list? Do you see an area of expertise or way we can enhance the StoryEngine project that we didn't include? To suggest new features and minor improvements to the existing project, file an issue and label it `enhancement`.

## Your first contribution
`beginner`issues are easy to contribute issues that can be done with minimal effort or knowledge of the project.

Suggesting edits or improvements to the following are another good place to start (label them `suggestions`)
- [README](https://github.com/LoupDesign/StoryEngine/blob/master/README.md) 
- [StoryEngine Guide](https://storyengine.io/guide) 

* Note that we appreciate specific suggestions and recommendations on how to improve our content or on any place content seems missing or is incomplete. We are also looking for any copy errors. (Does it make sense? Do you understand it? Is all the information you need there? Are there any typos?)

## Issue and pull request labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. If applicable, please use the following labels when filing an issue or pull request — this will help people find ways to contribute that match up with their talents. (Can have more than one label, for example `beginner` + `editors`)
