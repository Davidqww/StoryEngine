# Contributing to StoryEngine

Welcome! :boom::book: Thanks for your interest in contributing to StoryEngine — we're excited you're here! :book::boom:

StoryEngine is a way to do research and evaluation for anyone who wants to listen to the people that matter most to them. StoryEngine uses interviews to draft stories that are then edited with each participant. These stories can then be used for marketing, communications, advocacy, and more — while forming a dataset that can be used to surface insights and learning.

The following is a list of guidelines for contributing to the StoryEngine project which is hosted by [LoupDesign](https://github.com/LoupDesign). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute?

### Tackle an issue / further the project
Help us tackle issues. Use these [labels](#issue-and-pull-request-labels) to help find an issue that matches your talents.

### File an issue or pull request
File an issue for a specific suggestion, bug, or recommendation on how to improve our content or on any place content seems missing or is incomplete. We are also looking for any copy errors. (Does it make sense? Do you understand it? Is all the information you need there? Are there any typos?) Please use these [labels](#issue-and-pull-request-labels) (as applicable) to file an issue.

### Suggest an area of enhancement to the project
Don't see yourself on this list? Do you see an area of expertise or way we can enhance the StoryEngine project that we didn't include? To suggest new features and minor improvements to the existing project, file an issue and label it `enhancement`.

## Your first contribution
`beginner`issues are easy to contribute issues that can be done with minimal effort or knowledge of the project.

Suggesting edits or improvements to the following are another good place to start (label them `suggestions`)
- [README](https://github.com/LoupDesign/StoryEngine/blob/master/README.md) 
- [StoryEngine Guide](https://storyengine.io/guide) 

* Note that we appreciate specific suggestions and recommendations on how to improve our content or on any place content seems missing or is incomplete. We are also looking for any copy errors. (Does it make sense? Do you understand it? Is all the information you need there? Are there any typos?)
