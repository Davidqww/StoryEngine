# StoryEngine Roadmap

StoryEngine is a narrative-based methodology that can be used for research, evaluation, and grant reporting. Drawing on deep listening and participatory approaches, StoryEngine systematically collects and analyzes successes, challenges, practices, perceptions, and more â€” while generating assets that participants can use to promote and amplify their work.

Loup Design will provide mentorship and guidance for 1-2 organizations to implement StoryEngine over the course of the next 10 weeks.
