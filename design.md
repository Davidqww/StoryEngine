# Design

The objective of this phase is to establish your StoryEngine users and purposes, identify participants and other stakeholders, and finalize your question set. It assumes that you have already had a kickoff meeting to launch the project.

## 1. Clarify objectives, users, and purposes

Set up a series of design workshops, initially with the core team and then expanding to include other stakeholders as you identify and engage them. The idea is to co-create with the people who use the assets and the insights that will be generated — and ensure that they meet their needs. At the end of this step, you'll want to be clear about...

\_\_ **Your StoryEngine purpose\(s\) and learning objectives** — Why are you investing in StoryEngine? What do you want to learn or create? Define what will be generated and what will be different. It may be helpful to review the users in the[ Introduction](/README.md), as well as the examples in the [Use Cases](/use-cases.md).

\_\_ **Audiences and key stakeholders** —** **StoryEngine will generate assets, followed by insights.** **Who within your team will be transforming and/or using the assets you generate along the way? Likewise, who will use the final analytic outputs and recommendations? — Leadership? Your innovation team? Program designers? — Identify and engage all of these stakeholders as early as possible. \(Otherwise, you may find that no one is interested in all of the wonderful stories and learning you've produced!\)

\_\_ **Participants **— Who will you ask to participate in the interview process? How might the assets that you generate be useful to them — and what might you do to ensure that they reap the benefits? StoryEngine is designed to be non-extractive, meaning that we strive to create value for participants. The selection of participants is basically your sampling strategy. It's okay if it is not representative, as long as you're clear about your rationale and it serves your objectives. For example, during the StoryEngine pilot, we used a purposeful sample of individuals from different Mozilla Foundation program areas, with careful attention to background \(ranging from volunteers to Executive Directors\), geography, and gender. Be sure to include different voices in your sample, and be aware of the costs to participating, especially for people struggling with social and economic challenges.

\_\_ **Team roles and responsibilities **— In short, make sure everyone's on the same page with who is doing what. It can be helpful to create a basic spreadsheet with names, roles, and contact information. And we love using Trello to keep track of who's doing what.

## 2. Draft and test **your question set**

Don't overthink your initial question set. Use the outcomes of your design workshops to come up with something good enough, test it on each other \(or with friends and family\), refine, and then test with two or three participants, and check those results with some of your key stakeholders. Are you getting the information you need? If not, re-write and test again. An iterative process is best.

You may have heard people say, "Well, that's anecdotal evidence." But what we are looking for is exactly that: anecdotes. _**Specific and detailed examples drawn from experience.**_ So ensure that your questions should be open-ended and that they elicit concrete responses. A formulation we like to use is \_**"Tell me about a time when..." **\_Some participants might find this difficult, and will respond a with high-level, general statement — rather than a particular moment in time. For example, in the Mozilla pilot, we asked "Tell me about a time when you felt a sense of success."

| EXAMPLE: "Humans of the Internet" question set |
| :--- |
| INTRODUCE yourself to  |
| **Can you tell me a bit about your work? Perhaps starting with a broad overview, then highlighting what you’re working on now?** _Adjust for students and others, for example you may ask about what "they do" versus work. _ |
| **Thinking about your work, tell me about a time when you felt a sense of success. **_EXAMPLES: breakthrough, insight, interaction, approach — sense of accomplishment or pride. PROBE for a specific example/anecdote if response is too broad: That’s a great example of a type of success — Can you give me a specific anecdote or example related to that?_ |
| **How about an example of a challenge? **_EXAMPLES: Persistent or recurring challenge, current issue with work. PROBE for how they’ve approached addressing this challenge. _ |
| **This space is called “Humans of the Internet”… What — for you — is a “healthy internet”? **_NOTE: Some people find it difficult to answer such a broad question. Emphasize you’re not looking for a “right” answer but their own words. You may need to allow for some silence._ |
| Can you point to something that makes you feel optimistic for the future of the internet? |
| How about something that worries you about the internet? |
| What led you to be here at MozFest today? PROBE for pathways, what is valued, highlights so far |
| Anything more you want to tell me? Anything you want to ask? |

Of course, you may also want to include questions that surface knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions. An example of this is "What, for you, is a healthy internet?"

You can include probes or prompts for follow-up questions. rather than "What are some to elicit concrete and specific examples drawn from experiences— add prompts within questions to help people open up \(Example: for Mozilla, we came up with[11 questions](https://storyengine.io/questions/)— including questions that surfaced challenge and success stories, as well as pathways into Mozilla\).

* Use plain language, free of jargon or acronyms

* 
* Ask open-ended questions— prompting the respondent to answer with detail. Specifically, you are looking to ask open-ended questions that lead people to answer with an anecdote. A good way to prompt a person to tell you about a specific time or story is to use the language, “Tell me about a time when…”

* Add probing questions— questions in addition to your primary questions that help the interviewee to answer your question.

* After developing your question set, test them with family, friends, and/or colleagues

* * Pay attention to how they answer. Are your questions surfacing the types of responses you are looking for? Providing the right level of detail?

  * After you test the questions with them, ask them how they felt about the interview, whether or not they felt open and willing to talk, and if they have any suggestions to improve the question set.

## 3. **Test your questions**

Ask family, friends, or colleagues to help you test your question set \(refer to the [Guide to Develop Question Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxwAwloIrCGI9nruF8r7k5PQ10gcOXvY9rpD1nsYVTM/edit?usp=sharing) for more info on question testing\).

## 4. Finalize your i**nterview guide**

It's okay to update your questions as you  go. This will present some challenges in the analysis phase — but it's possible to work through those. Serving your stakeholders by producing usable assets and insights is the priority \(not being rigid and ensuring that the analysis is as easy as possible\).

Add your question set to the document and make any other necessary updates and edits to the document that reflect your specific project needs.

Once you have your set of questions and your interview guide, you’re ready to listen!
