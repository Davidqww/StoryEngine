## **Steps + tasks in the design phase **

### 1. S**urface questions and gaps**

Hold problem definition workshop\(s\) by bringing people to the table to talk about questions, concerns, problems, and gaps, and identify participants, audience, and roles and responsibilities. **Workshop Objectives **are listed below.

### 2. D**evelop your question set**

Use the [Guide to Develop Question Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxwAwloIrCGI9nruF8r7k5PQ10gcOXvY9rpD1nsYVTM/edit?usp=sharing) to develop your question set. You’re not going to find the perfect question set right away, but this methodology allows you to update your question set as needed.

### 3. **Test your questions**

Ask family, friends, or colleagues to help you test your question set \(refer to the [Guide to Develop Question Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxwAwloIrCGI9nruF8r7k5PQ10gcOXvY9rpD1nsYVTM/edit?usp=sharing) for more info on question testing\).

### 4. Update the i**nterview guide template**

Add your question set to the document and make any other necessary updates and edits to the document that reflect your specific project needs.

## **Workshop objectives**

**Surface questions, concerns, problems, and gaps** — within the organization that you’d like to address.

**Identify participants **— Who will you ask to participate in the interview process? We recommend a purposeful sample of individuals from different areas of expertise, backgrounds, and knowledge. Be aware and inclusive of gender, race, and class.** **

**Identify audience and key stakeholders** —** **Who are you sharing your insights, findings, and recommendations with? Who will be using the assets you build along the way? We recommend including these individuals as part of the StoryEngine planning process.

**Identify roles and responsibilities **— Who is responsible for what in this process? Use the [Guide to Roles and Responsibilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16M5oH_cgcxgXnhk5xuGS9wsiKasMDDukTWsqEnDrsvs/edit?usp=sharing) to assist you in distributing StoryEngine responsibilities.

Once you have your set of questions and your interview guide, you’re ready to listen!
