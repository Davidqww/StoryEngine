# Design

The objective of this phase is to establish your StoryEngine users and purposes, identify participants and other stakeholders, and finalize your question set. It assumes that you have already had a kickoff meeting to launch the project.

## 1. Clarify objectives, users, and purposes

This will likely be a series of workshops, initially with the core team and then expanding to include other stakeholders as you identify and engage them. The idea is to co-create with the people who use the assets and the insights that will be generated — and ensure that they meet their needs. At the end of this step, you'll want to be clear about...

\_\_ **Your StoryEngine purpose\(s\) and learning objectives** — Why are you investing in StoryEngine? What do you want to learn or create? Define what will be generated and what will be different. It may be helpful to review the users in the[ Introduction](/README.md), as well as the examples in the [Use Cases](/use-cases.md).

\_\_ **Audiences and key stakeholders** —** **StoryEngine will generate assets, followed by insights.** **Who within your team will be transforming and/or using the assets you generate along the way? Likewise, who will use the final analytic outputs and recommendations? — Leadership? Your innovation team? Program designers? — Identify and engage all of these stakeholders as early as possible. \(Otherwise, you may find that no one is interested in all of the wonderful stories and learning you've produced!\)

\_\_ **Participants **— Who will you ask to participate in the interview process? How might the assets that you generate be useful to them — and what might you do to ensure that they reap the benefits? StoryEngine is designed to be non-extractive, meaning that we strive to create value for participants. The selection of participants is basically your sampling strategy. It's okay if it is not representative, as long as you're clear about your rationale and it serves your objectives. For example, during the StoryEngine pilot, we used a purposeful sample of individuals from different Mozilla Foundation program areas, with careful attention to background \(ranging from volunteers to Executive Directors\), geography, and gender. Be sure to include different voices in your sample, and be aware of the costs to participating, especially for people struggling with social and economic challenges.

\_\_ **Team roles and responsibilities **— In short, make sure everyone's on the same page with who is doing what. It can be helpful to create a basic spreadsheet with names, roles, and contact information. And we love using Trello to keep track of who's doing what.

## 2. D**evelop your question set**

Use the [Guide to Develop Question Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxwAwloIrCGI9nruF8r7k5PQ10gcOXvY9rpD1nsYVTM/edit?usp=sharing) to develop your question set. You’re not going to find the perfect question set right away, but this methodology allows you to update your question set as needed.

Use the information gathered from your Problem Definition Workshop\(s\) and the information below to guide the development of your questions. You’re not going to find the perfect question set right away, but the StoryEngine methodology allows you to update your question set as needed.

* Keep in mind your participants and audience

* Develop questions that will surface concrete and specific examples of their experiences— add prompts within questions to help people open up \(Example: for Mozilla, we came up with[11 questions](https://storyengine.io/questions/)— including questions that surfaced challenge and success stories, as well as pathways into Mozilla\).

* Determine the purpose

* * What you would like to know?

  * Why is this important to know?
* Decide if you are looking to discover or uncover any of the following:

* * Attitude

  * Knowledge

  * Perceptions of knowledge, skills, or behavior
* Use plain language, free of jargon or acronyms

* Ask non-leading questions— questions that leave the respondent in a position to answer openly and honestly about how they feel \(leading questions are questions that prompt the respondent to answer in a specific way — usually in a way that lines up with your way of thinking\).

* Ask open-ended questions— prompting the respondent to answer with detail. Specifically, you are looking to ask open-ended questions that lead people to answer with an anecdote. A good way to prompt a person to tell you about a specific time or story is to use the language, “Tell me about a time when…”

* Add probing questions— questions in addition to your primary questions that help the interviewee to answer your question.

* After developing your question set, test them with family, friends, and/or colleagues

* * Pay attention to how they answer. Are your questions surfacing the types of responses you are looking for? Providing the right level of detail?

  * After you test the questions with them, ask them how they felt about the interview, whether or not they felt open and willing to talk, and if they have any suggestions to improve the question set.

## 3. **Test your questions**

Ask family, friends, or colleagues to help you test your question set \(refer to the [Guide to Develop Question Set](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxwAwloIrCGI9nruF8r7k5PQ10gcOXvY9rpD1nsYVTM/edit?usp=sharing) for more info on question testing\).

## 4. Finalize your i**nterview guide**

Add your question set to the document and make any other necessary updates and edits to the document that reflect your specific project needs.

Once you have your set of questions and your interview guide, you’re ready to listen!
