# Act & Loop Back

The Act & Loop is phase is focused on using and applying StoryEngine insights to strategy, practice, and design. \(It may be helpful at this point to review "[One process that delivers value to multiple stakeholders](/README.md)" in the Introduction.\) How insights are used depends on the objectives set up during the Design phase — although you can expect uses that you had not considered to emerge, especially if stories and the StoryEngine process have been well promoted.

StoryEngine emerged from participatory and human centered design \(HCD\) practices, and it is particularly well suited to deliver the insights required for the initial discovery / inspiration / empathize phase. The names differ depending on the framework, but basically this is the first phase of a design thinking / HCD process".

Unlike most design research methods, StoryEngine is designed to be ongoing — to serve as a platform for inquiry, feedback, and  deep listening and engagement with the people who matter most. Another difference is that we emphasize the importance of feedback as yet another way to deliver value to research participants, as well as to demonstrate that their voices and thoughts matter ­— and have impact. Acknowledging and elevating diverse voices is key to this work. 



#### The structure of this 

### Report back to participants

Let the participants know your findings to date.

### Use content as a tool

Use as design thinking tools \(like personas and journey maps\), as research prompts in workshop settings. This content can also be used for infoletters, communications teams,
