# Act & Loop Back

The Act & Loop is phase is focused on using and applying StoryEngine insights to strategy, practice, and design. \(It may be helpful at this point to review "[One process that delivers value to multiple stakeholders](/README.md)" in the Introduction.\) How insights are used depends on the objectives agreed on during the Design phase — although you can expect uses that you had not considered to emerge as well as requests for different uses, especially if stories and the StoryEngine process have been well promoted.

## Act: StoryEngine as part of a broader design process

StoryEngine emerged from participatory and human centered design \(HCD\) practices. As a design research methodology, it is particularly well suited to deliver the insights required for the initial discovery / inspiration / empathize phase. There are many well-documented HCD / design thinking guides and toolkits \(we've listed a few at the bottom of this chapter\), and so we won't duplicate that work here. As suggested in the Design phase, if one of the purposes of establishing a StoryEngine is to guide a broader innovation or design thinking process, then it is best \(but not necessary\) to have discussed and selected that from the outset — and to have included and engaged key stakeholders in early on.

## Loop back: A platform for ongoing engagement and inquiry

Unlike most design research methods, StoryEngine is can be ongoing — to serve as a platform for inquiry, feedback, and deep listening and engagement with the people who matter most. Another difference is that we emphasize the importance of **looping back** as yet another way to deliver value to research participants and to demonstrate that their voices and thoughts matter ­— and have an impact. Acknowledging and elevating diverse voices is key to this work. To dig into this a bit deeper, read [_**Building a Better Feedback Loop: How deep listening and storytelling help organizations thrive**_](https://medium.com/weseek/building-a-better-feedback-loop-764022914aa), which is all about the StoryEngine methodology.

## How should we approach this phase?

As noted above, the answer depends on your users and purposes. Action will likely be a series of design or strategy workshops where StoryEngine learning and insights are used and applied in practical ways — whether to create something new or to course correct. \[NOTE: As the methodology evolves we plan to share workshop templates to make this easy for you.\] Efforts to loop back mean communicating directly with participants, as well as creating opportunities for ongoing reflection and discussion. When you communicate about story edits in the [Process Narratives](/process-narratives.md) phase, you'll have plenty of opportunities to ask participants if they'd like to receive updates — and via what channels. For member- or network-driven organizations, updates can be integrated into existing communications — and events provide an excellent opportunity to share StoryEngine findings and facilitate discussions around actions and next steps.
