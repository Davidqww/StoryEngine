# Act & Loop Back

The Act & Loop is phase is focused on using and applying StoryEngine insights to strategy, practice, and design. \(It may be helpful at this point to review "[One process that delivers value to multiple stakeholders](/README.md)" in the Introduction.\) How insights are used depends on the objectives set up during the Design phase — although you can expect uses that you had not considered to emerge, especially if stories and the StoryEngine process have been well promoted .

StoryEngine emerged from participatory and human centered design \(HCD\) practices, and it is particularly well suited to deliver the insights required for the initial discovery / inspiration / empathize phase — basically the first phase of a design thinking / HCD process. Unlike most design research methods, StoryEngine is designed to be ongoing — a platform for deep listening and engagement with the people who matter most, as well as as for inquiry and feedback throughout the design process. 



 these are all called different . It is easy to surface robust customer profiles and journey maps from narratives. More importantly, StoryEngine is different from other methods in that it is non-extractive — it includes ways to generate value to participants — and can provide a platform for 



StoryEngine is essentially a design research methodology  The best design research is not a one-off activity conducted at the beginning of a project. Rather, Loup sees research as an opportunity for deep listening and ongoing engagement — for developing long-term relationships. Because of this, Loup seeks to create meaningful, valuable, and delightful research experiences —

. We have succeeded when participants use research outputs to meet their own needs and when feedback loops are adopted and integrated into organizational practices.

#### Share findings and learning

Once you have formatted your findings, you are ready to share them with your audience. Content can be shared in person at board meetings, or distributed through social media, infoletter, email.

### Report back to participants

Let the participants know your findings to date.

### Use content as a tool

Use as design thinking tools \(like personas and journey maps\), as research prompts in workshop settings. This content can also be used for infoletters, communications teams,
