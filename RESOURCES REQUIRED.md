# Resources required for using StoryEngine

To use StoryEngine, you will need:

* People, whether staff, volunteers, or other researchers / collaborators
* Access to computers
* Software for creating/editing text documents and spreadsheets

A low-tech version of StoryEngine can be implemented by a small team — assuming they have a broad skillset and can capture close-to verbatim notes. A full-scale implementation with public-facing narratives will require additional resources — as well as the **roles and skills**, **practices**, **hardware**, and **software** listed below.

* Recording equipment \(the quality will depend on what types of assets you plan to generate\)
* Audio editing software 
* A content management system and web hosting service

# Roles and skills

* Project lead with project management and human centred design facilitation skills
* Researcher\(s\) with good listening and interview skills
* Transcriptionist\(s\)
* Editor\(s\)
* Analyst\(s\) // people with qualitative data analysis skills
* Communicator\(s\) able to transform narratives into assets, experience with information design \(timelines, personas, change pathways, and other types of infographics\) and packaging research findings is a plus 

# Key practices

* **Create value for participants** — There are costs to participation. If we ask participants to take the time to articulate their experiences, learning, and insights, we should strive to provide some kind of value in return — beyond sharing findings. Our "non-extractive" practice is evolving and we welcome your feedback. Some of the ways that we have been giving back include creating space and helping participants articulate what they want to say, producing a story / content that they can use for other purposes, taking the time after an interview is completed to connect participants to people and resources, and making it easy for participants and others to share and promote stories. More broadly, we connect with our participants from a place of gratitude and a mission to elevate their voices and their work. 

* **Consent** — A system to request, document, and revoke consent — we typically use as two-step process with \(1\) consent to interview, and \(2\) consent to share or publish \(NOTE we are currently developing processes to allow participants to limit access to their data or revoke consent and remove their data\) — see [Building Consentful Tech](https://www.andalsotoo.net/2017/10/24/the-building-consentful-tech-zine-is-out/)

* **Responsible data management** — A clear policy for the collection, storage, use and destruction of participant data \(See the [Responsible Data Principles](https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/) + [Developing and Operationalizing Responsible Data Policies](https://lindaraftree.com/2016/10/31/developing-and-operationalizing-responsible-data-policies/)\)

# Hardware

* Computers
* Lavalier microphone\(s\)

# Software

* Skype + Ecamm, to record Skype calls \(or a similar tool for your OS\)
* Calendly, to easily schedule interviews
* HelloSign, an e-signature app to collect and document consent
* Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets — to store, edit, manage, and analyze data and narratives
* Quicktime, to simply export video interviews into audio files
* Audacity, to edit audio files
* Dedoose or RQDA — or another CAQDAS tool for analysis \(optional, it’s also possible to use a spreadsheet to conduct analysis\)
* [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) — to annotate narratives \(may be used in conjunction with analytic tools\)
* Wordpress + WPEngine to create and host a project website
* Social media — Twitter, Instagram, Facebook — to share public-facing stories
