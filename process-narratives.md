# Process Narratives

The objective of this phase is to process the participant’s story. The StoryEngine methodology is built to give the participant time to reflect and edit their interview transcript. We find that some people are not as well spoken as others, and others have a hard time sitting down to write out their stories. This process gives participants the opportunity to speak freely in an interview, have the help of an editor to clean up and highlight areas of concern, and reflect and edit their own story before publishing — we want participants to be happy with their stories.**                        
**

**IMPORTANT: Any information gathered during this stage should remain confidential, and not shared with anyone else **— not even with others at the organization. Permissions should be kept tight, and the number of people with access should remain minimal — only key personnel, specified at the beginning of the project, should have access.

## **Processing tools + services**

The following is a list of suggested tools, services, hardware, and software — these can be tailored to your organization and used accordingly.

* Transcriptions services
* [StoryEngine tracker — master tracker sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVMHKgSiJJqT7Yq3QvWhvZkGJZ3M9wps5ZfSD-XN0wM/edit#gid=0&range=E:E)
* [StoryEngine tracker — transcriptionist tracker sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVMHKgSiJJqT7Yq3QvWhvZkGJZ3M9wps5ZfSD-XN0wM/edit#gid=1212148835&range=A:A)
* Google docs
* [Editing guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5qTrHLxjW_5B39nCKpxmiFIe6zFkE0LmFydPWoAxXA/edit?usp=sharing)— This tool is especially helpful if you have multiple people editing interviews.
* [Boilerplate email templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCx5s-6B05lSf0hqZrH2C9yr4Nh6VLrZYzhNb9SzW0I/edit?usp=sharing)
* HelloSign \(or other esignature app\)

## **Steps + tasks in the processing phase**

### 1. **Update tracker spreadsheet **

Keep [master tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVMHKgSiJJqT7Yq3QvWhvZkGJZ3M9wps5ZfSD-XN0wM/edit#gid=0&range=E:E) and [transcriptionist tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVMHKgSiJJqT7Yq3QvWhvZkGJZ3M9wps5ZfSD-XN0wM/edit#gid=1212148835&range=A:A) sheets up-to-date with the latest information.

### 2. **Transcribe the audio file**

Decide and use appropriate service for transcription of audio files. Use natural language processing transcription services, such as [Trint](https://trint.com) for transcribing clear — high quality audio, and transcriptionist services to transcribe medium to low quality audio.

**IMPORTANT: Transcriptionists should sign an NDA before transcribing any audio related to the StoryEngine project.**

\_\_**Trint **is a text-based toolkit for transcribing, searching, and editing media content online. We use this to transcribe clear — high quality audio. The service transcribe an audio file in less time than the length of the audio file \(less than an hour for an hour long audio file\). Once the file is transcribed, you are able to listen to edit the transcription using their program — simply click on the text you would like to listen to or edit.

\_\_**Transcriptionist services **should be used for medium to low quality audio files. If hiring your own team of transcriptionists, we recommend tracking that information using the [StoryEngine tracker — transcriptionist tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVMHKgSiJJqT7Yq3QvWhvZkGJZ3M9wps5ZfSD-XN0wM/edit#gid=1212148835&range=A:A) sheet. More information on hiring a team of transcriptionists can be found in the StoryEngine History and Learning document under Evolution of Transcription Services.

### 3. **Create an editing or Google document**

Once you have the raw transcript saved under the raw transcripts folder, either open that file as a google doc \(should automatically open as a copy\) OR make a copy of the original.

**IMPORTANT: Due to potentially sensitive information, make sure to keep the permissions tight on all Google docs associated with this project** —** **“Link Sharing: Off — specific people,” \(Click on Share &gt; Advanced: make sure the following is selected: link sharing off, prevent other editors from changing access and adding new people, disable options to download, print, and copy for commenters and viewers\)

### 4. **Communicate with participant**

Use [boilerplate email template \(Editing Update\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCx5s-6B05lSf0hqZrH2C9yr4Nh6VLrZYzhNb9SzW0I/edit?usp=sharing), to communicate with participant on where you are in the StoryEngine process. This email explains the process you use to edit and prepare their story for publishing.

### 5. Edit their story

Use the [Editing Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5qTrHLxjW_5B39nCKpxmiFIe6zFkE0LmFydPWoAxXA/edit?usp=sharing) to edit the interview transcript.

### 6. **Gather bio, images and evidence links**

Search the internet to find any supporting “evidence” links — links such as their personal LinkedIn / Twitter / website, blogs, etc. Add these to the google doc before sending to the participant for approval — this will give the participant the chance to add any links of their own, or remove any links they don’t want published with their story.

### 7. **Request for review**

Use the [boilerplate email template \(Request for Review\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCx5s-6B05lSf0hqZrH2C9yr4Nh6VLrZYzhNb9SzW0I/edit?usp=sharing) to ask the participant to review their edited document, make any necessary changes, and for a picture if they haven’t shared one with you already.

### 8. **Request consent to publish**

Once you have heard back from the participant that they have made all the necessary changes and are ready to sign the consent form — use the language from the [boilerplate email template \(Consent to Publish\)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCx5s-6B05lSf0hqZrH2C9yr4Nh6VLrZYzhNb9SzW0I/edit?usp=sharing), [Consent to Publish template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YTlwbnCD3rVbRC689fUl_zWMv4X_8lyzEQZV5S8PvEE), and [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/) \(or other esignature service\), to request consent to publish their story.

## **Tips for handling transcription files**

**Save transcripts as .txt files and note the specific stage of the editing process they are in. Example:**

lastname\_firstname\_RAW.txt  
lastname\_firstname\_EDITING.txt  
lastname\_firstname\_APPOVED.txt

**Use language that specifies the sensitivities of the files saved within. Example:**

1\_Raw\_Transcripts\_NO\_SHARING  
2\_Processing\_Transcripts\_SHARED\_ONLY\_WITH\_PARTICIPANTS  
3\_Approved\_Transcripts

Once you have consent to publish, you are ready to share their story!
