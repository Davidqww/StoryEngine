StoryEngine is designed to be an ongoing process — a loop. It is flexible and adaptive, with room for improvement and customization. We encourage anyone who uses the methodology to adapt it to best serve your needs.

You’re listening and testing throughout the process, with the goal of building stronger and more systematic feedback loops with the people you serve.

Design → Listen → Process → Share → Analyse → Act + Loop Back

What follows is a summary of each of the six phases, guiding you through the purpose, the tools and services you may want to consider using, and the steps and tasks.
