# Analyze

The objective of the analysis phase is to surface insights and learning. The findings can then be packaged in ways that meet your user's needs.  in various ways, ranging from a high-level report to The objective of this phase is to organize and interpret the information in the interviews and to offer insights and understanding on topics of interest. It can provide explanations, interpretation of phenomena, and uncover trends in thought and opinions.

It’s going to feel messy, and that’s because it is. You’re looking for commonalities, differences, themes, and outliers — what matters to people? Why does it matter? How do people talk about, characterize, understand what’s going on? What surprised you?

Insights from your analysis should be summarized and released periodically.

## Steps + tasks in the analyze phase

### 1. Choose your qualitative data analysis tool

Find a qualitative coding tool that works for you. We’re currently hacking and testing Hypothes.is, to do our qualitative data analysis. \(Refer to StoryEngine History and Learning for more information on using Hypothes.is\)

### 2. Get to know the stories

Familiarize yourself with the corpus of published stories — skim through, take notes, and then read through the set of stories. Note-taking is especially helpful in determining your coding structure — what ideas, concepts, themes are you seeing?

### 3. Code published stories

Use the [Guide to Coding Stories](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mEQG7CUKEbP09EuCfKagTXZu9csWoOjRarRCDusEwnA) to code published stories.

### 4. Analyze and synthesize findings

Based on notes and coding, synthesize what’s happening in your data. Using your preset codes, purposefully look for answers to the questions you documented during the design phase. Then use emergent codes to organize emerging patterns and themes — what surprised you? What did you find that you weren’t looking for?

### 5. Format your findings

We recommend formatting your findings based on user needs — what are they trying to accomplish? The Mozilla initial [test report](https://storyengine.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/StoriesfromtheNetwork_MozillaFoundation_January2017-3.pdf) was framed based on their “5 Objectives and Key Results.”

Once you format your findings, you are ready to loop back
