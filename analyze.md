# Analyze

The objective of the Analysis phase is to surface insights and learning that meet your user's needs in terms of both content and format, as established during the Design phase workshops. That said, we're always delighted when an analysis generates surprises — something we didn't consider or know previously.

You can use any qualitative data analysis method or tools to analyze the corpus \(your set of stories\). No matter what approach you use, analysis is going to feel messy. Because it is. There's a lot of information to sift through. You’re looking for commonalities, differences, themes, and outliers — What matters to people? Why does it matter? How do people talk about, characterize, understand what’s going on?

During the pilot phase some Mozilla staff took the initiative to conduct their own analysis to inform their work. We heard that the analytic process was not smooth — but that it was super important, especially when done in collaboration with team members because then everyone had ownership over the findings.  

We recommend using both preset and emergent codes — preset codes are codes assigned to ideas, concepts, or themes you expect to find during analysis, and emergent codes are codes assigned to ideas, concepts, and themes as they emerge in your analysis.

.  in various ways, ranging from a high-level report to The objective of this phase is to organize and interpret the information in the interviews and to offer insights and understanding on topics of interest. It can provide explanations, interpretation of phenomena, and uncover trends in thought and opinions.

Insights from your analysis should be summarized and released periodically.

## Steps + tasks in the analyze phase

### 1. Choose your qualitative data analysis tool

Find a qualitative coding tool that works for you. We’re currently hacking and testing Hypothes.is, to do our qualitative data analysis. \(Refer to StoryEngine History and Learning for more information on using Hypothes.is\)

### 2. Get to know the stories

Familiarize yourself with the corpus of published stories — skim through, take notes, and then read through the set of stories. Note-taking is especially helpful in determining your coding structure — what ideas, concepts, themes are you seeing?

### 3. Code published stories

This document serves to guide you through the coding of StoryEngine data. StoryEngine is an ongoing learning process designed to surface concrete and specific examples of people’s experiences that provide insights to the questions you developed. It should also surface things you weren’t expecting to find — these surprises are just as important.

## What is a code?

A code is a short word or phrase assigned to an idea, concept, or theme. Coding your data is an essential part of performing qualitative data analysis — it helps you organize, sort, and visualize your data. It is iterative and will change as your analysis and work progresses.

## Coding your data

Assign identifier information to each interview— Decide what identifier information is important and assign identifier information accordingly. Examples of identifiers you might use: gender of participant, date of interview, age of participant, location of participant’s residence, and participant’s profession.

Determine preset codes and code your data set accordingly— Use your questions and notes to develop preset codes and initial coding structure — note that your coding structure will continue to develop over the coding process. Preset codes should cover ideas, concepts, and themes you expect to find based on the design of your questions — they will generally pop up in every interview, as the questions are specifically designed to uncover them. For example — we used the preset code, “success,” to identify passages of text in response to the question, “Tell me about a time you felt a sense of success.”

Use emergent codes to capture emerging ideas, concepts, and themes— As you make your way through the corpus, remember to utilize emergent codes to capture the things you didn’t expect to find.

Remember, coding is iterative and will change as your analysis and work progresses. This is especially true for emergent codes. You may find yourself combing back through interviews to make changes to your coding structure. For example, you may have coded passages of text in several interviews as “disagreement,” and in passages of text of other interviews as “dispute,” but later you realize that these two codes represent the same idea, so you synthesize your coding structure so that all “dispute” and “disagreement” codes are now “disagreement.”

### 4. Analyze and synthesize findings

Based on notes and coding, synthesize what’s happening in your data. Using your preset codes, purposefully look for answers to the questions you documented during the design phase. Then use emergent codes to organize emerging patterns and themes — what surprised you? What did you find that you weren’t looking for?

### 5. Format your findings

We recommend formatting your findings based on user needs — what are they trying to accomplish? The Mozilla initial [test report](https://storyengine.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/StoriesfromtheNetwork_MozillaFoundation_January2017-3.pdf) was framed based on their “5 Objectives and Key Results.”

Once you format your findings, you are ready to loop back
