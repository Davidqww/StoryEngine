# Welcome to the StoryEngine Repo!

StoryEngine ([website](https://storyengine.io), [guide](https://loup.gitbooks.io/storyengine/content/)) is a narrative-based methodology that can be used for research, evaluation, learning, and grant reporting. Drawing on deep listening and participatory approaches, StoryEngine systematically collects and analyzes successes, challenges, practices, perceptions, and more — while generating assets that participants can use to promote and amplify their work.

StoryEngine was specifically designed to serve organizational learning and innovation, power feedback loops, and provide insights to guide strategy and design decisions. Most importantly, it recognizes that _**an interview is an experience**_ — a touchpoint with an organization — and therefore an opportunity to build relationships, provide support, and make connections.

StoryEngine uses in-depth interviews to draft impact narratives that are then co-edited in collaboration with each participant. These narratives can then be used to **generate assets** — for marketing and communications, advocacy, onboarding, and more — while together forming a dataset that can be analyzed to surface **insights and learning**.

# Who might use StoryEngine?

StoryEngine can generate value across an organization — as well as for research participants. User profiles \(some tested, others in development\) are listed below. Note that StoryEngine can serve multiple stakeholders and purposes. For example, the process of collecting the data needed for an assessment can provide valuable assets for leadership, fundraising, and advocacy teams — with the added bonus of potentially getting different parts of the organization onto the same page.

## User profiles

* Leaders with organizational development, learning, and innovation agendas
* Participants / Interviewees — people the organization serves, including partners, volunteers, and members
* Network- / member-driven organizations, including associations 
* Designers of programs, services, products, and experiences 
* Evaluation, assessment, and learning and insights teams
* Grant writers and development teams
* Communications professionals, including advocacy, marketing, and public relations 
* Funders and grant managers 
* Conference organizers and attendees 
* Recruiting and onboarding / human resources teams 

For more detail on each of these use cases, read the Introduction to the [StoryEngine Guide](https://loup.gitbooks.io/storyengine/content/).

# Resources required

To use StoryEngine, you will need:

* People, whether staff, volunteers, or other researchers / collaborators
* Access to computers
* Software for creating/editing text documents and spreadsheets

A low-tech version of StoryEngine can be implemented by a small team — assuming they have a broad skillset and can capture close-to verbatim notes. A full-scale implementation with public-facing narratives will require additional resources — as well as the **roles and skills**, **practices**, **hardware**, and **software** listed below.

* Recording equipment \(the quality will depend on what types of assets you plan to generate\)
* Audio editing software 
* A content management system and web hosting service

# Roles and skills

* Project lead with project management and human centred design facilitation skills
* Researcher\(s\) with good listening and interview skills
* Transcriptionist\(s\)
* Editor\(s\)
* Analyst\(s\) // people with qualitative data analysis skills
* Communicator\(s\) able to transform narratives into assets, experience with information design \(timelines, personas, change pathways, and other types of infographics\) and packaging research findings is a plus 

# Key practices

* **Create value for participants** — There are costs to participation. If we ask participants to take the time to articulate their experiences, learning, and insights, we should strive to provide some kind of value in return — beyond sharing findings. Our "non-extractive" practice is evolving and we welcome your feedback. Some of the ways that we have been giving back include creating space and helping participants articulate what they want to say, producing a story / content that they can use for other purposes, taking the time after an interview is completed to connect participants to people and resources, and making it easy for participants and others to share and promote stories. More broadly, we connect with our participants from a place of gratitude and a mission to elevate their voices and their work. 

* **Consent** — A system to request, document, and revoke consent — we typically use as two-step process with \(1\) consent to interview, and \(2\) consent to share or publish \(NOTE we are currently developing processes to allow participants to limit access to their data or revoke consent and remove their data\) — see [Building Consentful Tech](https://www.andalsotoo.net/2017/10/24/the-building-consentful-tech-zine-is-out/)

* **Responsible data management** — A clear policy for the collection, storage, use and destruction of participant data \(See the [Responsible Data Principles](https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/) + [Developing and Operationalizing Responsible Data Policies](https://lindaraftree.com/2016/10/31/developing-and-operationalizing-responsible-data-policies/)\)

# Hardware

* Computers
* Lavalier microphone\(s\)

# Software

* Skype + Ecamm, to record Skype calls \(or a similar tool for your OS\)
* Calendly, to easily schedule interviews
* HelloSign, an e-signature app to collect and document consent
* Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets — to store, edit, manage, and analyze data and narratives
* Quicktime, to simply export video interviews into audio files
* Audacity, to edit audio files
* Dedoose or RQDA — or another CAQDAS tool for analysis \(optional, it’s also possible to use a spreadsheet to conduct analysis\)
* [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) — to annotate narratives \(may be used in conjunction with analytic tools\)
* Wordpress + WPEngine to create and host a project website
* Social media — Twitter, Instagram, Facebook — to share public-facing stories 

# Where are we now?

StoryEngine was developed by [Loup](https://loup.design) for the [Mozilla Foundation](https://mozilla.org). The pilot phase is now complete, as well as the initial documentation for others to use and adapt. Mozilla has institutionalized key StoryEngine practices and narratives will be shared via Mozilla Pulse. Loup will continue to steward StoryEngine’s development, and is currently using it with other organizations. See the Learning and History sections in the documentation to learn more.
